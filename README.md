LimitPinchGestureZoom
=====================

Limit UIPinchGestureRecognizer Zoom for any UIView

The code sample shows two things.
1. Use multiple gestures together to create a responsive user experience with media content.
2. How to zoom using the UIPinchGestureRecognizer and limit the zoom extents as well as speed.

I have used this code in my iPhone apps and recently revised it to make it easier to use as discussed on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5449865/276626)
